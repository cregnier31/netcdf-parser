&lt;p&gt;
  Results are provided for the domain "North Sea, Norwegian Sea", but note that the number of
  observation platforms and their areal coverage is very limited.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Statistics for significant wave height are based on buoy and platform data from offshore operators
  reporting to MET Norway in near-real time. Note that observations and the system for collecting
  and distributes them are all operated and owned by the individual operators and provided in kind
  to MET for the use of wave forecast verification. The observations are a mixture of platform
  mounted directional wave radars and platform mounted altimeters. Currently 29 platform sites are
  reporting on a regular basis. Most of the systems reports significant wave height and peak period
  data every 10 minutes. The model outputs instantaneous values every hour. 
&lt;/p&gt;
