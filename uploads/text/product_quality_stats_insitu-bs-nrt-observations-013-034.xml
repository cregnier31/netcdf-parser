<title>Summary</title>
<body>  The In Situ TAC relies on observing systems maintained by institutes that are not part of the In Situ TAC and MyOcean project is not contributing to the maintenance and setting up of the observing systems it uses. The variety of platforms available to monitor the status of the ocean is very diverse within the different regions. The in situ observations are acquired with a wide variety of instruments with different acuracy : Argo floats, surface drifters, moorings, research vessels, tide gages (http://www.myocean.eu/web/41-in-situ.php). In some regions the number of available platforms is on a critical low level to provide an adequate representative overall view of the state of the ocean. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The provided figures show the coverage in time and space on the in situ observations for the last quarter.
