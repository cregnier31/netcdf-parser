<title>Summary</title>
<body>
This diagnostic is based on the SLA comparison at altimeters cross-over locations, after intercalibration processing.&lt;/br&gt;
The diagnostic highlights the consistency of the measurements from different altimeters (multi-mission cross-over locations), or between ascending and descending passes for the same altimeter (mono-mission cross-over locations).&lt;/br&gt;
The standard deviation of SLA differences at cross-over locations gives an indication of measurement errors (errors with temporal scales less than 10 days) even if ocean variability also contributes.
The variability observed at cross-over locations (with less than 10-day lag) usually ranges from 4 to 5 cm (mean over the global ocean), with good consistency between the different altimeters.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
