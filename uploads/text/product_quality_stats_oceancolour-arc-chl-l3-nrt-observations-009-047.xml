OCTAC QI Interpretative text

The daily 1 km resolution Quality Index is calculated on a pixel-by-pixel over valid observations as:

QI = ( CurrentDataPixel - ClimatologyDataPixel ) / STDDataPixel

with ClimatologyDataPixel and STDDataPixel being the 1km daily average and standard deviation climatology, respectively. The daily reference climatology maps have been created using CCIv3 data (merged SeaWIFS,MERIS,MODIS,VIIRS [1997-205]) falling into a moving temporal window of +/- 5 days. Current day data products are subsampled at the climatology resolution and the QI remapped back to the native current data resolution (e.g. 1 km). Time series plot show the percentage number of valid pixels falling into each STD interval (from -5 to 5, bin=1STD) and provide a means for detecting any sensor calibration issue that might affect data quality. Single QI images can be viewed on relevant Production Units websites. For the current day data pixel to be considered good, QI is expected to be within 2 STDs.
