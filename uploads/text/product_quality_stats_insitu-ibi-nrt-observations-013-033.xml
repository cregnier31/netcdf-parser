<title>Summary</title>
<body>  The In Situ TAC relies on observing systems maintained by institutes that are not part of the In Situ TAC and MyOcean project is not contributing to the maintenance and setting up of the observing systems it uses. The variety of platforms available to monitor the status of the ocean is very diverse within the different regions. In the IBI region, the in situ observations are acquired with a wide variety of instruments with different acuracy : Argo floats, surface drifters, moorings, research vessels, voluntary observing vessels, Ferrybox vessels, gliders, tide gages (http://www.myocean.eu/web/41-in-situ.php), with a total number of available platforms in real time around 450.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The provided figures show the coverage in time and space on the in situ observations and the data quality for the last quarter in the IBI region.
