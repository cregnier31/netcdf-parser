<title>Summary</title>

&lt;p&gt;
Statistics are computed as differences between daily mean analysis and forecasts model outputs with respect to CMEMS in-situ and satellite observations. Metrics are presented for the entire Mediterranean Sea and 16 sub-regions as well as along 9 vertical layers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Statistics for salinity and temperature are based on data from CMEMS INS-TAC: vertical profiles from Argo floats, Gliders, XBTs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Statistics of SST are evaluated using CMEMS OSI-TAC satellite L4 and L3 regional products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Statistics of SLA are based on data from CMEMS SL-TAC: along tracks data from Cryosat, Altika, Jason 2/3, Sentinel3 satellites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Additional information including model misfits evaluation are also available here: http://medforecast.bo.ingv.it/mfs-copernicus-evaluation/.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moreover, temperature, salinity, sea level and currents observations from moored buoys are used to obtain an independent validation available here: http://calval.bo.ingv.it/.
